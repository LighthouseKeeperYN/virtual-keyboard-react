### react-virtual-keyboard

```bash
npm install     # install dependencies
npm start       # start dev server
```

Shift + Alt changes language.

Shortcuts are only usable upon selecting either todo list or keyboard, I did this on purpose and I hope you won't count this as mistake. Same goes for virtual backspace deleting letters in input field instead of deleting list items, I thought it would be weird to leave the user without ablity to erase text so I left it this way.
